# JStefanelli.com Front-end

This is the actual website directory. 

With all the files being completely static, this front-end can be deployed via any web server.

## Building

Run the following commands to build the website for production:

```
npm ci
npm run prod
```

To build in development, run `npm run dev`.

The website is entirely static, so it can be debugged by simply opening the `build/index.html` file in any browser.
